I have spent over a decade building and leading engineering teams at Shopify, a journey that has progressed my career from a Software Developer to an Engineering Manager. During this period, I built dozens of web apps and managed remote engineering teams, playing a pivotal role in expanding the engineering capabilities across multiple projects.

I specialize in Ruby, Rails, Python, and Go, providing me with a robust foundation in distributed cloud applications. As an Engineering Manager, I have successfully led and mentored remote teams, enhancing both individual and collective performance. My leadership approach emphasizes mentorship and targeted skill development, aiming to maximize the efficiency of my team.
