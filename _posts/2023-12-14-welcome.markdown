Here is the first post of my blog. Over the years I've had various blogs on various platforms, mainly to promote my businesses. The latest was my [record label](https://atam.ca/blogs/atam-productions) homepage (last updated in 2017), and before that I was promoting my [magician business](https://www.alexthegreat.ca/blogs/ottawa-magic-news) (last updated in 2015) so this will be my first writings in a long time!

Here is a quick code snippet to welcome you to my blog:
{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Guest')
#=> prints 'Hi, Guest' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Thanks for reading!
